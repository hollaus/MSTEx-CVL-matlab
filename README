Abstract:
In the first step of the approach, the binarization method of Su et al. [1] is applied on a single image that has been captured at a wavelength of 500nm. The output of this method is used for the estimation of the mean spectral signature of the writing. This signature is used to train the Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE), which is suggested by Scharf and Whorter [2]. The output of the ACE detector is then Otsu thresholded and combined with the output of the binarization method of Su et al., by making use of heuristics. The source code of method is available at https://github.com/hollaus/MSTEx-CVL-matlab.
